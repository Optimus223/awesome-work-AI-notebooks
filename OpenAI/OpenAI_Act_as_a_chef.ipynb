    "### Setup Variables\n",
    "- `name`: Plugin name to be displayed on naas.\n",
    "- `model`: ID of the model to use. You can find a list of available models and their IDs on the [OpenAI API documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/overview).\n",
    "- `prompt`: This is the text prompt that you want to send to the OpenAI API.\n",
    "- `temperature` (Defaults to 1): This is a value that controls the level of randomness in the generated text. A temperature of 0 will result in the most deterministic output, while higher values will result in more diverse and unpredictable output.\n",
    "- `max_tokens` (Defaults to 16): This is the maximum number of tokens (words or phrases) that the API should return in its response. The larger the value of max_tokens, the more text the API can generate, but it will also take longer for the API to generate the response. The token count of your prompt plus max_tokens cannot exceed the model's context length. Most models have a context length of 2048 tokens (except for the newest models, which support 4096)."
