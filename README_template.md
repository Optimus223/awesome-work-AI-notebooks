## About Naas
Naas is a data platform that enable anyone with minimal technical knowledge to turn  <a href="https://jupyter.org" target="_blank">Jupyter Notebooks</a> into powerful automation, analytical and AI engines thanks to <a href="https://docs.naas.ai/" target="_blank">low-code formulas</a>.<br>

The platform is based on 3 elements:<br>
- The **templates** enable anyone to use data engines on all kind of subjects in minutes.
- The low-code **drivers** act as connectors to facilitate access to tools, and complex libraries (database, API, ML algorithm...)
- The low-code **features** (scheduling, asset sharing, notifications...) turns Notebooks into production ready data engines.<br>

Naas is forever free to use with 100 credits/month.<br>

## Naas Templates
The aim of this repository is to be the largest aggregator of production ready Jupyter Notebooks templates.
To do so, we have defined a framework that enable easy understanding and scaling of Notebooks: 
Each notebook is organized with the following msections:  
- Title: "Tool - Action of the notebook"
- Description: a one-liner explaining the benefits of the notebooks for the user 
- Tags: hastags of the topics the notebook is about
- Input: list of all the variables, credentials, that needs to be setup 
- Model: list the functions applied to the data 
- Output: list the assets to be used by the user and its distribution channels if any.

The repository is organized by source/tools.
Managed by Naas core-team and community ⭐️.

→ Feel free to use the Issues tab to add any templates you would like to see, or contribute to.
