## What is Naas ?

Naas is an all-in-one data platform that enable anyone with minimal technical knowledge to turn <a href="https://jupyter.org" target="_blank">Jupyter Notebooks</a> into powerful automation, analytical and AI data products thanks to <a href="https://docs.naas.ai/" target="_blank">low-code formulas</a> and microservices.<br>

The platform is based on 3 low-code layers:<br>
- **üòé Templates**: enable anyone to use data engines on all kind of subjects in minutes.
- **üèé Drivers**: connectors to facilitate access to tools, and complex libraries (database, API, ML algorithm...)
- **ü™ê Features**: production microservices on top of Jupyter like scheduling, asset sharing, notifications and more.<br>

Naas Cloud is free to use with 100 credits/month.<br>

## What is the objective of this repository ?

The objective of this repository is to create the largest catalog of production-ready Jupyter Notebooks templates. With those templates, it becomes easy to create data products (analytical dashboards, automation/AI engines and more). Check out the [data-product-template](https://github.com/jupyter-naas/data-product-template) repository to learn more.<br>
The repository is organized by source/tools for easy discovery. You can also use our ["Google-like" search](http://search.live.kn.naas.ai/) to find templates by keywords<br>

To ensure the quality of the templates, we have defined a framework. Each notebook shall be organized with the following sections:  
- **Naas logo**
- **# Title**: "Tool - Action of the notebook", as h1 (an "Open in Naas" button will be automatically added by the CI/CD when a notebook is merged to the master branch)
- **Tags**: hastags of the topics the notebook is about, as text
- **Author**: name and social profile link of the author(s), as text
- **Description**: a one-liner explaining the benefits of the notebooks for the user, as text
- **## Input**: list of all the variables, credentials, that needs to be setup, as h2
- **## Model**: list the functions applied to the data, as h2
- **## Output**: list the assets to be used by the user and its distribution channels if any, as h2
