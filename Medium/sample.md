# Naas Templates[![Awesome](https://cdn.rawgit.com/sindresorhus/awesome/d7305f38d29fed78fa85652e3a63e154dd8e8829/media/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome)
(aka the "awesome-notebooks") 

## What is the objective of this repository ?
The objective of this repository is to create the largest catalog of production-ready Jupyter Notebooks templates. With those templates, it becomes easy to create data products (analytical dashboards, automation/AI engines and more).

Each of these templates adheres to a consistent framework, designed to expedite your coding process. While these templates are designed for ease of use, some may require data science skills for setup, particularly those that interface with third-party tools via API. These templates can function independently, but they also serve as integral components of data products. Consider them as the essential parts needed to assemble your 'car engine'. By developing these templates and ensuring their standalone functionality, we streamline the process of data product development, as we already comprehend the operation of some parts within it.

All templates are readily accessible on [GitHub](https://github.com/jupyter-naas/awesome-notebooks) or via [Naas Search](https://naas.ai/search).

## How is organized a template?

To ensure the quality of the templates, we have defined a framework. Each notebook shall be organized as follow.
